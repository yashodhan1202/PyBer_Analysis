# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis ##
The purpose of the analysis is to portray the differences in data of ride-sharing by city type and how the differences can be used by the decision makers of PyBer to take informed sound decisions.

## Resources ##
Jupyter Lab, Python

## Results ##

Following parameters were arranged to understand the relationship between rides, drivers, fare and city types :

1) Total Drivers
2) Total Rides
3) Total Fares
4) Average Fare per ride
5) Average Fare per driver

It can be seen from the image above that the highest number of rides were recorded for the urban city type followed by suburban and rural. Likewise in the same order the total drivers were highest in the urban city type. There are more drivers in the urban areas than the rides  which tells that many times drivers are idle and do not have rides vice a versa for suburban and rural areas the drivers are less than the rides which means the drivers have repeat rides as well. There is an inverse relationship between the price and the ride or driver availability. Since there are more rides and drivers available in urban areas the average fare is lower and likewise the average fare in suburban and rural areas is more as the ride or driver availability is less.

Further analysis based on total fare by city type for a specific time frame (1st Jan 2019 -29th April 2019) revealed the following :-

1) There is a huge gap between the total fare for urban and rural type.
2) Pyber is not that preferred as and how a person moves away from the urban city and other modes of transport might be preferred.
3) There is a spike in activity of all the three city types for a brief from end of February 2019 to mid March 2019

## Summary ##

Based on the analysis done so far, following recommendation can be made to PyBer:-  

1) Recruit more drivers in rural areas from the urban areas as the urban areas have excess drivers than the rides.
2) Charges in the urban cities can be increased slightly and decreased in rural and suburban areas. This can be done by taking short online consumer surveys which will help in answering the question of how much is the consumer willing to pay for a ride. 
3) Increase consumer based marketing in rural and suburban areas citing the advantages of affordability and highest quality of service to generate awareness and create demand.
