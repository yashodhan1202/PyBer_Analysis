# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis ##
The purpose of the analysis is to portray the differences in data of ride-sharing by city type and how the differences can be used by the decision makers of PyBer to take informed sound decisions.

## Resources ##
Jupyter Lab, Python

## Results ##

Following parameters were arranged to understand the relationship between rides, drivers, fare and city types :

1) Total Drivers
2) Total Rides
3) Total Fares
4) Average Fare per ride
5) Average Fare per driver

It can be seen from the image above that the highest number of rides were recorded for the urban city type followed by suburban and rural. Likewise in the same order the total drivers were highest in the urban city type. There are more drivers in the urban areas than the rides  which tells that many times drivers are idle and do not have rides vice a versa for suburban and rural areas the drivers are less than the rides which means the drivers have repeat rides as well. There is an inverse relationship between the price and the ride or driver availability. Since there are more rides and drivers available in urban areas the average fare is lower and likewise the average fare in suburban and rural areas is more as the ride or driver availability is less.

Further analysis based on total fare by city type for a specific time fare revealed the following :-
